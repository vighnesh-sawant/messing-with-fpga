# messing-with-fpga
This just me having fun with an fpga

These two folders have the source  
src/  
fpga/ffpga/src  
# starter branch
This just has both the mcu and fpga flashing led after 1s
This was just hello word of hardware (blinky)

# uart branch
In this i have implement an uart on the fpga!!
Learnt about how to implement a state machine in hardware using verilog   
Digital Design is cool,in software we have to do so much just to get concurrency here we just get it for free lol!  
I was learning software concurrency before this and I am just amazed currently.
Took me too much time though I think, but learning takes time I guess.

# More
I'll be doing more projects on the fpga soon.

# Demo
Look at the demo folder, it has two videos with demos!!
